Currently:

1.  We have two databases: 1. Spotify API   2. Deez API
2.  Getting songs from spotify API and using this to play music through the Deez API

What we want:

1. We want to create a datebase, which checks through deez api, finds ones which match 
a song from the spotify and add this song to our new database:

1.   Spotify id
2.   Deeze api id
3.   Artist
4.   Song name
5.   URL to play INTEGER
....
